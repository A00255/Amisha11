A perfusion bioreactor is an advanced cell culture system that allows continuous nutrient exchange and waste removal while maintaining a steady-state environment for cell growth. Unlike traditional batch or fed-batch bioreactors, perfusion bioreactors enable high-density cell cultures by continuously supplying fresh media and removing spent media. This technology is widely used in biopharmaceutical manufacturing, regenerative medicine, and tissue engineering due to its efficiency in producing high yields of biologics, vaccines, and other cell-based products.
