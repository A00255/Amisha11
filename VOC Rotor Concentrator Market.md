The VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) Rotor Concentrator market revolves around air pollution control systems that focus on capturing and concentrating VOC emissions from industrial processes. These concentrators use rotating honeycomb structures embedded with adsorbents such as zeolite to trap VOCs before desorbing them in a smaller volume, making them easier to destroy using oxidation or other methods. They are widely used in industries such as transportation, semiconductor manufacturing, and general industrial production to comply with stringent environmental regulations and enhance sustainability efforts.
