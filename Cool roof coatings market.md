Cool roof coatings are specialized reflective coatings designed to reduce the absorption of solar radiation and lower roof surface temperatures. These coatings are available in various formulations, including elastomeric, acrylic, silicone, and infrared (IR) reflective coatings. Their primary function is to improve energy efficiency in buildings by reflecting sunlight and reducing heat absorption. They are widely used in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings to mitigate the urban heat island effect, reduce cooling costs, and enhance roof durability.
