Helical Wire Rope Isolators (HWRIs) are highly efficient vibration and shock isolation devices composed of stainless steel wire ropes that provide damping and resilience in demanding applications. These isolators are widely used in aerospace, defense, HVAC systems, industrial manufacturing, and railway transit systems. Due to their durability, corrosion resistance, and capacity to absorb high shock loads, they are ideal for environments requiring long-term performance in extreme conditions.
