Xylooligosaccharides (XOS) are a type of prebiotic composed of oligomers of xylose, which are sugar molecules derived from the hemicellulose component of plant cell walls, specifically xylan. XOS typically consist of 2-10 xylose units linked by β-1,4-glycosidic bonds. They serve as functional sugars that promote gut health and enhance beneficial gut microbiota.
