The global ammonium bicarbonate market was valued at approximately USD 1228.36 million in 2023. However, it is projected to decline to USD 799.88 million by 2029, reflecting a negative compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of -6.90%. This decline is attributed to regulatory changes, environmental concerns, and a shift toward alternative leavening agents in the food industry.



**Market Dynamics**



Drivers



Growing Demand in Agriculture – Ammonium bicarbonate is widely used as a nitrogen fertilizer, particularly in developing economies where cost-effective agricultural solutions are needed.

Extensive Usage in the Food Industry – It is a key ingredient in baked goods like biscuits and crackers due to its ability to release carbon dioxide at low temperatures.

Affordability and Easy Availability – The compound is inexpensive and readily available, making it a preferred choice in emerging markets.



Restraints



Stringent Environmental Regulations – Due to ammonia emissions and environmental concerns, regulatory restrictions in North America and Europe are limiting its usage.

Shift Toward Alternative Leavening Agents – The food industry is increasingly adopting safer, more sustainable alternatives, impacting market demand.

Health Concerns – Ammonium bicarbonate has been linked to potential health risks when used excessively in food products, leading to reduced consumption.



Opportunities



Growing Adoption in Developing Markets – Countries in Asia-Pacific, particularly China and India, continue to use ammonium bicarbonate due to its low cost and effective results in agriculture and food processing.
